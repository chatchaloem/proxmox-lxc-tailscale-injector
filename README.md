## üìã Installation Steps

1. **Access Your Proxmox Server:**
   - Open a terminal or SSH into your Proxmox server.

2. **Download the Script:**
   - You can navigate to the directory where you'd like to store the script. Use the command below to download:
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/chatchaloem/proxmox-lxc-tailscale-injector/releases/latest/download/tailscale-injector.sh
     ```
   - Replace `tailscale-injector.sh` with the actual filename if it's different in the latest release.

3. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Run this command to allow the script to be executed:
     ```bash
     chmod +x tailscale-injector.sh
     ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script with:
     ```bash
     ./tailscale-injector.sh
     ```

5. **Verify Permissions:**
   - After running, ensure that your LXC containers have `/dev/net/tun` permissions set correctly.
   - Check this by running the following command for each container:
     ```bash
     lxc config get <container-name> security.nesting
     ```
   - Replace `<container-name>` with your actual container name.

## üîÑ How It Works

This script works by modifying the configuration of your LXC containers within Proxmox. It automates the process of granting necessary permissions, making it easier for Tailscale to function as intended. This way, you can seamlessly connect your containers over a secure network.

- **Permission Denied:** Make sure you are running the script with the necessary privileges. Use `sudo` if required.
- **Network Issues:** Check your internet connection and ensure your Proxmox server has access to external networks.
- **Unsupported Version:** Ensure your Proxmox version supports the LXC features necessary for the script.
